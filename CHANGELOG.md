# Change Log

## [Unreleased]

### 04/04/2025
#### Fixed
- **Loop in `loadSponsors` Dispatching**
  - **Description:** Resolved an infinite loop caused by redundant `loadSponsors` dispatches in `useSponsorDashboard.js`, `Dashboard.jsx`, and `SponsorHub.jsx`.
  - **Reason:** Multiple components were dispatching `loadSponsors` on mount and state changes, causing a cycle of API requests, state updates, and re-renders.
  - **Impact:** Stops the loop, reduces API load, and makes the app responsive again. Content (e.g., `SponsorHub`, `Calendar`) is now visible.
  - **Files Changed:**
    - `useSponsorDashboard.js`: Centralized `loadSponsors` dispatching, added `isFetching` state to prevent multiple fetches, adjusted `useEffect` dependencies.
    - `Dashboard.jsx`: Removed redundant `loadSponsors` dispatch, adjusted `useEffect` dependencies.
    - `SponsorHub.jsx`: Removed redundant `loadSponsors` dispatch.
  - **Next Steps:** Test rendering, verify all components display, re-enable debug logs.

- **Error in `debug.js` (`className.includes is not a function`)**
  - **Description:** Fixed an error in `getDashboardLayoutStyles` where `className.includes` was called on non-string values (e.g., `SVGAnimatedString`).
  - **Reason:** `element.className` can be an `SVGAnimatedString` or `undefined`, which doesn’t have an `includes` method.
  - **Impact:** Allows `getDashboardLayoutStyles` to complete and log the DOM tree, aiding in debugging display issues.
  - **Files Changed:**
    - `debug.js`: Added a type check in `isRelevantElement` to ensure `className` is a string before calling `includes`.
  - **Next Steps:** Test `getDashboardLayoutStyles`, confirm DOM tree is logged, verify all components are captured.

#### Changed
- **Reapplied Layout Fixes in `global.css`**
  - **Description:** Reapplied previous fix for vertical text stacking in Ant Design typography and added rules to ensure `Row`, `Col`, and `Table` components render full-width.
  - **Reason:** Potential display issues after recent changes; previous fix for vertical text stacking might have been overridden.
  - **Impact:** Ensures text (e.g., "Sponsor Dashboard") renders horizontally, and components take full width without overlap.
  - **Files Changed:**
    - `global.css`: Reinforced typography fix with higher specificity, added full-width rules for `ant-row`, `ant-col`, and `ant-table`.
  - **Next Steps:** Test layout on different screen sizes, verify content visibility, confirm no overlap.

#### Added
- **Change Log (`CHANGELOG.md`)**
  - **Description:** Created a change log to track all modifications, including dates, descriptions, reasons, impacts, and next steps.
  - **Reason:** To prevent issues like display breaking by maintaining a record of changes and fixes.
  - **Impact:** Improves debugging and development by providing a history of changes.
  - **Files Changed:**
    - `CHANGELOG.md`: New file created.
  - **Next Steps:** Maintain the change log with each update.

- **Connectivity Log (`CONNECTIVITY_LOG.md`)**
  - **Description:** Created a connectivity log to document the system’s structure, dependencies, purposes, and future enhancements.
  - **Reason:** To improve debugging and development by providing a clear map of how components and files are interconnected.
  - **Impact:** Helps prevent issues by clarifying dependencies and relationships.
  - **Files Changed:**
    - `CONNECTIVITY_LOG.md`: New file created.
  - **Next Steps:** Maintain the connectivity log with each update, expand as new components are added.

  - **Impact:** Content now spans full width, components render side by side on larger screens, search bar and tier filter are aligned horizontally.
  - **Files Changed:**
    - `global.css`: Adjusted `.erp-content`, `.content-wrapper`, `ant-row`, `ant-col` styles; added `.sponsor-hub-controls` for alignment.

  - **Files Changed:**
    - `global.css`: Adjusted margins on `.ant-layout-content`, `.erp-content`, removed overriding `ant-col` styles, reinforced `.fc` styles.
    - `Calendar.jsx`: Modified to always render FullCalendar, showing fallback message above it.
    - `ErpLayout/index.jsx`: Reapplied `flex: 1` to inner `Layout`, fixed `defaultSelectedKeys` in `Menu`.
  - **Next Steps:** Test layout on different screen sizes, confirm `Calendar` renders, verify alignment.

  # Change Log

## [Unreleased]

### 04/04/2025
#### Fixed
- **Loop in `loadSponsors` Dispatching**
  - **Description:** Resolved an infinite loop caused by redundant `loadSponsors` dispatches in `useSponsorDashboard.js`, `Dashboard.jsx`, and `SponsorHub.jsx`.
  - **Reason:** Multiple components were dispatching `loadSponsors` on mount and state changes, causing a cycle of API requests, state updates, and re-renders.
  - **Impact:** Stops the loop, reduces API load, and makes the app responsive again. Content (e.g., `SponsorHub`, `Calendar`) is now visible.
  - **Files Changed:**
    - `useSponsorDashboard.js`: Centralized `loadSponsors` dispatching, added `isFetching` state to prevent multiple fetches, adjusted `useEffect` dependencies.
    - `Dashboard.jsx`: Removed redundant `loadSponsors` dispatch, adjusted `useEffect` dependencies.
    - `SponsorHub.jsx`: Removed redundant `loadSponsors` dispatch.
  - **Next Steps:** Test rendering, verify all components display, re-enable debug logs.

- **Error in `debug.js` (`className.includes is not a function`)**
  - **Description:** Fixed an error in `getDashboardLayoutStyles` when calling `className.includes` on non-string values.
  - **Reason:** `element.className` can be an `SVGAnimatedString` or `undefined`, which doesn’t have an `includes` method.
  - **Impact:** Allows `getDashboardLayoutStyles` to complete and log the DOM tree, aiding in debugging display issues.
  - **Files Changed:**
    - `debug.js`: Added a type check in `isRelevantElement` to ensure `className` is a string before calling `includes`.
  - **Next Steps:** Test `getDashboardLayoutStyles`, confirm DOM tree is logged, verify all components are captured.

- **Sponsors Not Loading from Database**
  - **Description:** Attempted to fix `filteredSponsors` being empty despite backend returning data.
  - **Reason:** Mismatch in Redux state path; expected `state.sponsors.sponsors` but reducer updates `state.sponsors.items`.
  - **Impact:** Expected sponsors to load, but issue persists; further investigation needed.
  - **Files Changed:**
    - `useSponsorDashboard.js`: Updated `useSelector` to access `state.sponsors.items`, added debug logs to confirm state shape.
  - **Next Steps:** Review reducer (frontend/src/redux/sponsors/reducer.js) and API response (backend/src/controllers/appControllers/sponsorController.js), test sponsor data loading.

- **Display Issues (Layout and Alignment)**
  - **Description:** Fixed narrow layout, vertical stacking of components, and ensured FullCalendar renders.
  - **Reason:** Large margins on `.ant-layout-content` and overriding `ant-col` styles caused narrow content and vertical stacking; FullCalendar had style/initialization issues.
  - **Impact:** Content now spans full width, components render side by side on larger screens, FullCalendar renders even if empty.
  - **Files Changed:**
    - `global.css`: Adjusted margins on `.ant-layout-content`, `.erp-content`, removed overriding `ant-col` styles, reinforced `.fc` styles.
    - `Calendar.jsx`: Modified to always render FullCalendar, showing fallback message above it.
    - `ErpLayout/index.jsx`: Reapplied `flex: 1` to inner `Layout`, fixed `defaultSelectedKeys` in `Menu`.
  - **Next Steps:** Test layout on different screen sizes, confirm `Calendar` renders, verify alignment.
