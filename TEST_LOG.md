### Test Session: Verify Sponsor Data Loading and Display Fixes
- **Timestamp:** 04/04/2025, 1:00 PM
- **Test Cases:**
  - **Test 1: Sponsors Load from Database**
    - **Steps:** Load the dashboard, check if `SponsorHub` shows sponsors from the database (e.g., "Sponsor1" to "Sponsor10").
    - **Expected Outcome:** `DataTable` shows database sponsors, not test data.
    - **Actual Outcome:** Still shows test data; `filteredSponsors` is empty.
    - **Issue:** State update issue in `useSponsorDashboard.js` (logged in `ERROR_LOG.md`).
  - **Test 2: Calendar Renders**
    - **Steps:** Load the dashboard, check if `Calendar` renders the FullCalendar UI.
    - **Expected Outcome:** Calendar renders, even if empty (no events).
    - **Actual Outcome:** Shows fallback message ("No events to display").
    - **Issue:** `sponsors` is empty, so `events` is empty (depends on Test 1 fix).
  - **Test 3: Layout and Alignment**
    - **Steps:** Load the dashboard, check if `SponsorHub`, `EmployeeDash`, and `Calendar` render side by side on large screens, and if search bar/tier filter are aligned horizontally.
    - **Expected Outcome:** Components render side by side, controls are aligned horizontally.
    - **Actual Outcome:** Components stack vertically, controls stack vertically.
    - **Issue:** `global.css` styles for `ant-row`, `ant-col`, and controls need adjustment (fixed in this update).
  - **Test 4: Notifications**
    - **Steps:** Add a sponsor via the "Add Sponsor" button, check if a notification ("Sponsor added successfully!") appears.
    - **Expected Outcome:** Notification appears after adding a sponsor.
    - **Actual Outcome:** Not tested yet (waiting for sponsor data fix).
    - **Issue:** None (pending test).
- **Next Steps:** Retest after fixing sponsor data loading, confirm Calendar renders, verify layout and notifications.

- Upload file via UI (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit): Failed (timeout at `waitForURL('/dashboard')`)  
- API analyze/upload (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit): Passed  
**Actual Outcome**: 6/12 passed (API), 6/12 failed (UI) due to post-login crash and layout instability.  
**Issue**: Frontend errors (`DataTable`, `SponsorModal`) and display issues prevent dashboard access.  
**Next Steps**:  
- Fix frontend errors and layout in new chat.  
- Retest with `npx playwright test tests/grok.test.js --headed --timeout 120000`.
