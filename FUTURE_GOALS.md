Allur Space Console: Future Goals and Enhancements
Overview
The Allur Space Console is the autonomous platform for building and maintaining complex programs within the IDURAR ERP/CRM ecosystem, delivering badass apps for Woodkey Festival, Hi-Way Drive-In, Chase N Daisies, and Camp Carson by Q2 2025 (July 2025). Powered by Grok 3 (free/paid), its CRM administers Frugal Coupon Book, Funny List, AllurTasks (Micro Service), AllurSphere (Sphere Social), Scalable AI Persona Management System, and Advanced Digital Asset Management System (ADAMS), which appear independent but are interconnected, utilizing each other as resources with ALL Token (symbol: ALL, 0x732bd2988098244fe6133dfd304216764f1f088e, 99M supply) for rewards. The primary goal is to complete the console to autonomously build/maintain all components, ensuring a festival-friendly, scalable system under your oversight.
